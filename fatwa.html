     <h1>FASTING:</h1> 
    <p>
        Fasting is obligatory upon every sane, post-pubescent Muslim, capable of fasting the month of RAMADAN
        other than women observing their monthly menses or post-partum bleeding.</p>
        <p>Able children should be ordered to fast 
        in order to become accustomed to its practice
    </p>
    <h2>The time of Ramadan's commencement is known by one of two signs:</h2>
        <p>
            1) Sighting the new moon by a trustworthy Muslim, male or female;</p>
        <p>    2) Completing the thirty days of the month of Sha'ban.</p>
                
            <p>The time of the obligatory fast is from Fajr until Maghrib. The person should have the intention to fast before Fajr.
        </p>
        <h2>The Nullifiers of the Fast:</h2>
            <p>
                The fast is nullified by the following:

                1) Sexual intercourse in the vagina. one must make up that day and expiate the sin of this act 
                    by <h4> A) Freeing a slave </h4> 
                       <h4> B) Fast two(2) consecutive months. </h4>
                       <h4> C) Feed sixty(60) poor people; </h4></p>

            <p>    2) Ejaculation due to kissing, hugging or masturbation. etc
                    There is nothing due for a person who has wet dream;</p>

            <p>    3) Eating or drinking something intentionally.
                    If someone does so forgetting that he is fasting, 
                    the fast remains correct (and he continues the fast till sunset);</p>

            <p>    4) Letting blood, by means such as cupping or blood donation.
                    A little amount for a medical examination and unintentional bleeding, 
                    like a wound, does not nullify the fast;</p>

                5) Intentional vomiting;
        <h2>Fasting is not nullified by the following:</h2> 
                    <p> * Dust entering one's throat; </p> 
                    <p> * Water unintentionally comes to one's throat while washing his mouth; </p>
                    <p> * Ejaculation due to thinking about desire; </p>
                    <p> * Wet dreams; </p> 
                    <p> * Unintentional bleeding; </p>
                    <p> * Unintentional vomiting; </p>
                    <p> If someone eats thinking that it is night and then it becomes clear that
                        is the day , he must make up for that day 
                     </p>
                     <p> If he eats doubting the coming of the dawn, thinking that it is still 
                         night-time, his fast is still valid, but if he eats not certain about 
                         the setting of the sun,</p> 
                         <p>and it happens to still be daytime, he must make up for that day 
                        </p>

                <h2>Those Allowed not to Fast:</h2>
                    <p> * It is prohibited for a person not to fast unless he has a legitimate excuse. </p> 
                    <p> * Women in their monthly menses and post-partum bleeding must break the fast. </p>
                    <p> * When saving someone's life is conditional on breaking a person's fast, 
                        it is obligatory upon that person to break his fast. </p>
                    <p> * It is sunnah for the traveller to break his fast if the journey is long 
                        enough to allow shortened prayers and if fasting is difficult for him. </p> 
                    <p> * It is also sunnah for a sick person not to fast if he fears that fasting
                        might cause him harm. </p>
